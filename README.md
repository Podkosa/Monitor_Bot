## Bot

HTTP server, handling incoming requests (REST, slash commands, integrations, webhooks etc.). On-demand checks.

## Watchdog

Periodically monitors servers with Checkers and alerts through Handlers.
Can be run in two ways:

1. Integrated (default).
Launch inside the bot async event loop. *Keep in mind that they both will share a single thread, therefore can impact performance and even block one another.*
More compact option, but not fit for scaling.
2. Standalone.
Run `watchdog.py` as a separate process/container, even without the bot.
3. Disabled.
You can turn off the watchdog completely and run checks from the bot at your own pace.

## Settings

Define your servers, handlers, integrations and other settings declaratively in `settings.yml`. See `example.settings.yml`.<br>

## Integrations

- Slack: alerts to channels and slash commands. Install Moni in your Workspace with `./integrations_docs/slack_app_manifest.yml`.

## TODO

- Telegram integration
- Email handler
- Alert when X is not normal for more than N time
- Slack timeout for /commands is 3 seconds. Refactor to delay the response.
- Slack button on an alert to open up related service
- Web interface for settings and checks
- Endpoint to show loaded checkers and handlers
- Endpoint to add servers to monitoring, turn on/off already configured ones
- More alert handlers
- More server checkers
- Proper loop exit
- Optional multiprocessing, when there will be more checkers
- Tests
